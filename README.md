# Solaris_R3_ESPHome
This repo contains a base config for using ESPHome and MQTT to tranfer UART_2 data from a Rotex Solaris R3 to Home Assistant.
The code is inspired by https://github.com/juanferrla/rotex_solaris/tree/main
For the details on the cable connection, please see the repo of juanferrla.
As the custom_component is deprecated in HA / ESPHome, I´ve chosen a different way to send the data to HA.
You´ll need a MQTT server for that too.
